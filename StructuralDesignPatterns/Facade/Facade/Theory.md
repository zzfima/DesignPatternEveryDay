## What is Facade Design Pattern?
Façade Design Pattern states that you need to provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. 
The Façade Design Pattern defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

In simple words, we can say that the Facade Design Pattern is used to hide the complexities of a system 
and provides an easy-to-use interface to the client using which the client can access the system.
