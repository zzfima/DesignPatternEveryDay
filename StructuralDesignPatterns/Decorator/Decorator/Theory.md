## What is Decorator Design Pattern?
The Decorator Design Pattern in C# allows us to dynamically add new functionalities to an existing object 
without altering or modifying its structure and this design pattern acts as a wrapper to the existing class. 

That means Decorator Design Pattern dynamically changes the functionality of an object at runtime without 
impacting the existing functionality of the object. 
In short, this design pattern adds additional functionalities to the object by wrapping it. 
A decorator is an object that adds features to another object.

Also: 
We use inheritance or composition to extend the behavior of an object,
but this is done at compile time and its applicable to all the instances of the class. 
We can’t add any new functionality of remove any existing behavior at runtime - this is when Decorator pattern comes into picture.
