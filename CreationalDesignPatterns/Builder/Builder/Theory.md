## What is Builder Design Pattern?
The Builder Design Pattern builds a complex object using many simple objects and using a step-by-step approach. 
The Process of constructing a complex object should be generic so that the same construction process can be used 
to create different representations of the same complex object.
So, the Builder Design Pattern is all about separating the construction process from its representation. 
When the construction process of your object is very complex then only you need to use to Builder Design Pattern.
