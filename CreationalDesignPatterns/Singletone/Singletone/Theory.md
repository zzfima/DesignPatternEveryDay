## What is Singletone Design Pattern?
We need to use the Singleton Design Pattern in C# when we need to ensures that only one instance 
of a particular class is going to be created and then provide simple global access to that instance for the entire application.

### The Advantages of using the Singleton Design Pattern in C#
1. The first and most important advantage of using the singleton design pattern in C# is that it takes care of concurrent access to the shared resource. 
That means if we are sharing a resource with multiple clients simultaneously, then concurrent access to that resource is well managed by the singleton design pattern.
2. It can be lazy-loaded and also has Static Initialization.
3. To share common data i.e. master data and configuration data which is not changed that frequently in an application. In that case, we need to cache the objects in memory.
4. As it provides a single global point of access to a particular instance, so it is easy to maintain.
5. To reduce the overhead of instantiating a heavy object again and again.

### Some Real-time scenarios where you can use the Singleton Design Pattern
1. Service Proxies: As we know invoking a Service API is an extensive operation in an application. The process that taking most of the time is creating the Service client in order to invoke the service API. If you create the Service proxy as Singleton then it will improve the performance of your application.
2. Facades: You can also create Database connections as Singleton which can improve the performance of the application.
3. Logs: In an application, performing the I/O operation on a file is an expensive operation. If you create your Logger as Singleton then it will improve the performance of the I/O operation.
4. Data sharing: If you have any constant values or configuration values then you can keep these values in Singleton So that these can be read by other components of the application.
5. Caching: As we know fetching the data from a database is a time-consuming process. In your application, you can cache the master and configuration in memory which will avoid the DB calls. In such situations, the Singleton class can be used to handle the caching with thread synchronization in an efficient manner which drastically improves the performance of the application. 

### The disadvantages of using the Singleton Design Pattern in C#
1. Unit testing is very difficult because it introduces a global state into an application.
2. It reduces the potential for parallelism within a program because to access the singleton instance in a multi-threaded environment, you need to serialize the object by using locking.
