## What is Abstract Factory Design Pattern?
The Abstract Factory Design Pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of 
individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes. 
In simple words we can say, the Abstract Factory is a super factory that creates other factories. 
This Abstract Factory is also called the Factory of Factories.
